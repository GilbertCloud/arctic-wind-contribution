# Processing code

All processing code requires Casper computing to run. Processing code that uses CESM2 data starts with raw single-variable timeseries, generated by CUPiD (https://github.com/NCAR/CUPiD).


## Code files

- Processing_functions.py: Python script containing custom processing functions
- Proc_GISTEMPv4.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for munging GISTEMP temperature anomaly data
- Proc_ERA5_surf.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for munging ERA5 surface temperature and sea ice concentration data

### Raw single-variable timeseries to processed single-variable timeseries
- Proc_CESM2_piControl_lessmelt.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for munging PI-lessmelt and PI-control timeseries
- Proc_moremelt_piControl.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for munging PI-moremelt timeseries
- Proc_PiC_UVnudge_single_run.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for munging any wind nudging experiment timeseries with 1 ensemble member
- Proc_PIC_UVnudge_ensemble.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for munging any wind nudging experiment timeseries with multiple ensemble members

### Processed single-variable timeseries to plottable data
- Proc_moremelt_piControl_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for doing final munging of PI-control, PI-lessmelt, and PI-moremelt data
- Proc_PiC_UVnudge_analaysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for doing final munging of all wind nudging experiment data

## Processing code run order:
1) Start with CUPiD generated single-variable timeseries
2) Use appropriate Jupyter notebook for dataset to transform raw single-variable timeseries to processed single-variable timeseries
3) Use appropriate Jupyter notebook for dataset to transform processed single-variable timeseries into plottable data
4) Take plottable data and input into appropriate plotting code Jupyter notebook (see plotting_code folder)
